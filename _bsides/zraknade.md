    "Zrak nade" is a Serbian Association of the Recipients of Psychiatric Services and Their Families. They needed a website that would be useful to many groups: patients and their relatives, volunteers who want to help their cause, people who want to donate... I've created a simple, clean website for them, with user-friendly navigation that allows visitors to quickly find the relevant information and tests in case of emergency. Folks from "Zrak nade" can also promote their trainings, seminars, forums, and workshops for the members of the Association through a simple back-end interface, and even respond to anonymous tests that visitors can take on the website.
