description: Robert and his team hired me to design and build a marketing website for their new app that helps you collect donations for your personal cause. They needed to explain the novel idea behind their app in a fun and relatable way. I made cute, relatable illustrations and icons that show how DonationTable makes it easy for busy parents to collect donations.
