description: A cute little website for a Mexican auto repair shop. Their old website was a gorgeous piece of Y2K Matrix-inspired, table-based design, so I made sure to keep that look and feel, while making the website modern and responsive. I designed and built a custom Wordpress theme, using Timber and custom fields to make the homepage a breeze to update.
