        <h2 class="ttu tracked f5 mb4">Experience</h2>
        <p class="measure-wide">I’ve been working as a freelancer and consultant since 2006, using words, pictures and code to help out clients all over the world. I had a chance to work on a colorful selection of projects—from L.A. rappers and Dutch apps for kids, to Croatian funeral a cappella choirs and Yale academics. It was a blast, I met a lot of brilliant people and learned the upsides and downsides of working remotely.</p>
        <p class="measure-wide">I’m still accepting short-term projects, but what I’m really looking for is a group of awesome people creating smart, easy-to-use digital products or services. If this sounds like you and you’d like to have a chat about working together, <a href="mailto:dzvlais@gmail.com">send me an email</a>.</p>
