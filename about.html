	<p class="measure-wide">Since 2017, I've been working at HOV, a remote-first product studio/venture studio / accelerator, as lead designer.</p>
    <p class="measure-wide">Before that, I’ve spent 10+ years as a freelancer and consultant, working on a colorful selection of projects—from L.A. rappers and apps for kids, to Croatian funeral a cappella choirs and Yale academics. It was a blast, I met a lot of brilliant people and learned the upsides and downsides of working remotely.</p>
    <p class="measure-wide">Right now, I'm looking to join a team of talented and kind people working on useful and ethical products. If this sounds like you and you’d like to have a chat about working together, <a href="mailto:dzvlais@gmail.com">send me an email</a>.</p>
